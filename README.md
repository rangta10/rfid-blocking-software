# RFID Blocking Software (Simulation)

A Python-based simulation tool that monitors and detects suspicious RFID scan attempts using time-window based logic.

This project demonstrates how repeated RFID scan attempts can be detected and flagged as suspicious activity.

---

## Overview

RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is commonly used in:

- Credit and debit cards
- Access control systems
- Toll collection
- Asset tracking systems

This project simulates a monitoring system that:

- Detects RFID scan attempts
- Tracks scan frequency within a defined time window
- Triggers alerts when suspicious behavior is detected

---

## Features

- Time-window based monitoring
- Configurable scan threshold
- Continuous real-time monitoring
- Clean object-oriented implementation
- No external dependencies

---

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rfid-blocking-software.git
cd rfid-blocking-software
